# ClickCircle

ClickCircle is an interactive web application that generates circles at the cursor's position when clicked. The app creates two circles on two separate clicks: one on the first click and another on the second. Each circle has a random radius ranging from 20px to 200px, and they are accurately positioned using the `clientX` and `clientY` values of the mouse event.

## Features
- Click to create circles at the cursor's location.
- Each circle has a random radius between 20px and 200px.
- The app creates two circles, one on the first click and another on the second.
- Fully responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Used for handling the component logic and state management.

- **JavaScript**: Used for random radius generation and accurate positioning of circles based on the mouse event.
